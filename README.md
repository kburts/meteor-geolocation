# Meet Me at the Corner

An interactive Google Maps MeteorJs project to help find your friends. 

## Goal

Get experience making a cross platform (browser, mobile browser, mobile app) in MeteorJs. 

Learn a new frontend framework (happens to be Ionic in the form of Meteoric this project.)

## Install / Run

Simply do a git clone, then meteor command in the directory.
Change google maps api key in [GoogleMaps.load()](https://github.com/dburles/meteor-google-maps#googlemapsloadoptions)

You need a public setting (Meteor.settings) "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY", which should be a JS client key, to display the map.
