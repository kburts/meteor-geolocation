# Meet Me at the Corner

An interactive Google Maps MeteorJs project to help find your friends. 

## Goal

Without a deadline, you can never finish. I've made a lot of almost websites, apps and other programs, but rarely
get to say I finished something. So the goal for meet me at the corner is to finally finish a project.
It's very late in the development, but it seems like as good of a time as any to get some project specs down for
being ready for release, which are in the GitHub issues. 

Get experience making a cross platform (browser, mobile browser, mobile app) in MeteorJs. 

Learn a new frontend framework (happens to be Ionic in the form of Meteoric this project.)

## Install / Run

Simply do a git clone, then meteor command in the directory.
Change google maps api key in [GoogleMaps.load()](https://github.com/dburles/meteor-google-maps#googlemapsloadoptions)

You need a public setting (Meteor.settings) "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY", which should be a JS client key, to display the map.
